1. Start by concatenating together all of the aligned video files.

Crop regions of the video files affected by alignment.


If vid_files contains the names of the video files

Y1=[];
for i=1:length(vid_files)
	load(vid_files{i})
	%Y is the variable contained in the variable
	Y1=cat(3,Y1,uint8(Y(h_low,h_high,w_low,w_high,:);
end
Y=Y1;
Ysiz=size(Y);
save('full_video','Y','Ysiz','-v7.3')


2. Run either full_demo_endoscope, or autoNeuronExtraction full_demo_endoscope outputs a neuron representing the extraction. autoNeuronExtraction saves extractions using several different parameters, and outputs a combined extraction.
