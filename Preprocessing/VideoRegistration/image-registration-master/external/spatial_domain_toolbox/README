			 General Information

This is spatial_domain_toolbox-2.1, a collection of matlab functions
and scripts written by Gunnar Farnebäck. Originally this contained
implementations of some of the algorithms described in his Ph.D. thesis
"Polynomial Expansion for Orientation and Motion Estimation" but has
subsequently been extended with other algorithms. A common theme is
that the algorithms work on multidimensional signals and are designed
and used directly in the spatial (or spatiotemporal) domain, without
involving e.g. Fourier or wavelet transforms. Some functions even more
generally apply to  multidimensional arrays. 

Download instructions for the latest version should always be
available at http://www.imt.liu.se/mi/tools/.

Author is Gunnar Farnebäck, gunnar@imt.liu.se.


			 News in Version 2.1

* New general function neighborhoodloop.
* Significantly improved function tensorprod (but see next section!).
* New general function outerprod.
* Significant improvements of arrayloop.
* New function antigradient for reconstruction from gradients.
* Bugfixes.

See the file NEWS for details and older news.


		   Important Notice for Version 2.1

The function tensorprod has been changed in a way that is not
backwards compatible. If you have used the old tensorprod you need to
update your code for the new definition or if appropriate convert to
the new function outerprod.

			    Prerequisites

In order for this toolbox to be useful, you need to have Matlab
installed. The toolbox has been tested with Matlab 7.


			     Installation

Untar the archive and copy all files to a directory where Matlab can
find them. You also need to compile the C mex files. This is most
easily done by running the following code in the toolbox directory:

files = dir();
for name = {files.name}
    file = name{1};
    if file(end) == 'c' && file(end-1) == '.'
        mex(file);
    end
end

			 Further Development

New algorithms and functions are added from time to time. Development
versions are available in a subversion repository at
http://lsvn.lysator.liu.se/svnroot/spatial_domain_toolbox/trunk.
This is best accessed using a subversion client, see 
http://subversion.tigris.org, but a common web browser can also be
used to access the most recent versions of the files.


			     Bug Reports

Please send bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, and success stories
to the author at gunnar@imt.liu.se. The toolbox is of course provided as
is, no warranty, etc.
