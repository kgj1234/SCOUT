This directory contains the Yosemite fly-through sequence, with the
frames in tiff format and the correct flow for the middle frame in
matlab format. THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL SOURCE FOR THIS SEQUENCE. If
you want to convert it into some other format, please start over with
[Insert URL here. The address I thought I had seem to be broken.]


Below follows the relevant excerpts from the README by John Barron,
which documents the original distribution of this sequence and a few
other ones:

------------
(f) yos. - the famous Yosemite Fly-Through sequence produced by Lynn Quam at SRI.
The motion of the clouds is 2 pixel to the right while the rest of the flow
is divergent, with speed of about 5 pixels/frame in the lower left corner.
Note that the Yosemite sequence is only 15 images, numbered 2 to 16 (9 is the
middle image).
[Note: originally the cloud motion was assumed to (1,0) but this is incorrect,
as was pointed out to me by Michel Hafner at the University of Zurich.]
------------
the Yosemite data is 316*252.
------------
(7) new_correct_yos (correct_yos is the correct Yosemite flow when
    the cloud motion is assumed to be (1,0), new_correct_yos has the
    cloud motion at (2,0))
