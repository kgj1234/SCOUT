2.1

- Bugfix in polyexp_solve_system.c. Polyexp could crash under specific
  circumstances with complex data and nonconstant certainty.
- Changed functionality of tensorprod.m, NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE!
- New mex function tensorprodc.c.
- New function outerprod to compute outer products of arrays.
- New function neighborhoodloop which works like arrayloop but
  generates neighborhoods around each point, which are passed to a
  callback function.
- New function antigradient to reconstruct a function from its
  possibly noisy gradients.
- Bugfixes in arrayloop.c.
- Function handles and inline functions can be used in arrayloop.
- Complex input can be used in arrayloop.
- estimate_disparity is less broken.

2.0 Released December 17, 2002

- New function arrayloop to speed up certain types of loops (doing the
  actual looping in C mex code instead of matlab code).
- conv3 generalized to complex signals.
- conv3 generalized to 4D signals and kernels.
- normconv generalized to complex signals and basis functions.
- polyexp generalized to complex signals.
- polyexp generalized to 4D signals.
- polyexp and normconv can compute output certainty.
- New function make_Abc_fast for quick computation of quadratic
  polynomial expansion with Gaussian applicability.
- New function make_Abc_interlace for interlaced 2D signals.
- New function poly_to_tensor to compute orientation tensors from
  quadratic polynomial expansion coefficients.
- Implementation of 4D tensors in make_tensors_fast finally works.
- csegment has changed name to velocity_segment and has been documented.
- New function estimate_disparity.
- New function estimate_displacement.
- New function one_frame_motion.
- One optional parameter added to evaluate_velocity.
- test_yosemite reconstructs all yosemite results in the thesis.
- Several bugfixes and documentation improvements.
- All references to Ph.D thesis instead of licentiate thesis.

1.2 Released May 15, 2002

- New files polyexp.m, polyexp_solve_systems.c, and
  polyexp_solve_systems.m, implementing polynomial expansion.

1.1 Released August 21, 2001

- New files normconv.c and normconv.m, implementing normalized
  convolution.
