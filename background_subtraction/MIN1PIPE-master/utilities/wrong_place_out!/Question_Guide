For anyone asking a specific question regarding the performance of MIN1PIPE, here are some quick tips (requirements) if you really want to understand the reason/cause of issues:

1. Please provide the parameters you used for the run. No algorithm can do everything with zero parameter, and why parameters exist is because they affect performance. It is meaningless (thus a waste of both our time) to talk about performance without providing parameters.

2. Please provide the basic details of your video, i.e. pixel resolution, length etc. The validity of the parameters depends on them.

3. Reemphasize the importance of 1. Please be aware that you might choose the wrong parameters and thus be cautious when you try to acribe the issue to MIN1PIPE.

4. Please be polite. In the open source community, no one should be forced to do anything.

5. TBA
