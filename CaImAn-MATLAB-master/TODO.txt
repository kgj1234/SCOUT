##TODO : 

1) need to test the simple mode on bigger dataset and with the 
method available on matlab2017. 

2) need to use the json matab package to see if the saving is working well

3) clicks are not performed well on some complex ROI shapes.

4) give more flexibility in the input and output parameters to allow the GUI
to be called at different stages of the pipeline and to be close at different
stages as well
